# Bhagyalakshmi's Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This space showcases my journey as a data science student with hands-on experience in data visualization, and a strong foundation in Java. My passion lies in analyzing data and gradually expanding into designing and developing complete software solutions, covering both frontend and backend technologies.

Through various internships and projects, I've developed expertise in end-to-end full-stack software development. I am always eager to learn new techniques in the rapidly evolving field of AI and data science.
